## How to use this book

This book is intended to form the backbone for the course Data Analytics and Machine Learning at UCLL.

Alongside the theoretical explanations in the book, you will also have access to DataCamp exercises to practice the concepts we introduce here. In addition, there are a series of labs where you are asked to apply everything you've learned in a Jupyter Notebook, closer to a real data analytics project.

If you find any issues with this book, we encourage you to Open an Issue to report them to the authors. In this way, the book can be improved and updated as needed and the lecturers will know if anything hasn't been communicated effectively to the students.

At the top of every page you'll see the Github icon with Open Issue link where you can report any issue you find.
