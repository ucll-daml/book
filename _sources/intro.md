# Introduction

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.

It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

We can do focus on the content first and worry about all the advanced featurs later.
